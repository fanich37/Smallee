### Public methods

**`init()`** - if the instance was previously destroyed it could be reinit with this method:

```js
const mySlider = new Smallee({ selector: '.my-slider' });
/* some code */
mySlider.destroy(); // the Smallee instance is desroyed ðŸ˜­
/* some code */
mySlider.init(); // but it's back ðŸ˜Š
```

**`changeSlide(direction)`** - change the slide. direction can be `'prev'` or `'next'`:

```js
mySlider.changeSlide('prev');
mySlider.changeSlide('next');
```

**`refresh()`** - refresh the instance and set new dimensions for slides, track and so on:

```js
mySlider.refresh();
```

**`destroy()`** destroy the instance ðŸ˜­. this method returns `null`, so if you don't need to initialize it later it's possible to completely destroy the instance:

```js
mySlider.destroy(); // can be re-inited later
let mySlider2 = new Smallee({ selector: '.my-slider2' });
mySlider2 = mySlider2.destroy(); // can't be re-inited. mySlider2 is just a null it this case
```
